# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 58: April 7, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Working on the personal library project. I got the routes all working and passing the tests. Now I just need to write the tests.

**Thoughts**: This project is considerably easier than the issue tracker. I think its because of how they wanted the database set up.
