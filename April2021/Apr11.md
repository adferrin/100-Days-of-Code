# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 62: April 11, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: working through the failing test. I couldn't figure out how to pass it but I did figure out what I am looking for.    

**Thoughts**: I will spend some more time on it tomorrow but I am also going to start writing some of the tests because I need it done.
