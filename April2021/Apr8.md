# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 59: April 8, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the personal library project. 

**Thoughts**: I had problems again with repl.it but I think it may have been on my end. Either way I am tired of using it and kinda bummed that it has to be this way. Oh well
