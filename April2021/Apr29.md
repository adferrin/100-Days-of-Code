# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 76: April 29, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I was looking for something new to keep on with my 100 days of coding and I think I am going to do the Information security course from FCC.   

**Thoughts**: Seems good and I would like to use python again.
