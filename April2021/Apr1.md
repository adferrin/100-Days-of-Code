# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 52: April 1, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I got the database connected to my project. I threw an error but I think its just because I haven't finished it. I was able to check and see that on Mongo's site that it did create an object with my information but I couldn't do it twice. 

**Thoughts**: Ohh well, I will just be optomistic and assume that it will work when I am finished.
