# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 70: April 22, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I forgot to do a commit yesterday... my bad. I was trying to figure out why my last test is not passing still and figured out my logic is a bit backwards. That being said if I want to fix it I might have to re do some of it. oops  

**Thoughts**: This could be more annoying than I thought. 

Update - I figured it out. my logic was literally backwards and changing the true to false in the first if statements for check row / col / region worked!!! all done and on to the british translator
