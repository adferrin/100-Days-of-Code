# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 61: April 12, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the functionality of the project. I am passing all but one test and haven't been able to make sense of it yet. If value submitted to /api/check is already placed in puzzle on that coordinate, the returned value will be an object containing a valid property with true if value is not conflicting. My checker does this so I think it has something to do with how I am checking.  

**Thoughts**: back at it tomorrow
