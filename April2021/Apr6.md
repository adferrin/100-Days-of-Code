# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 57: April 6, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Issue tracker project today. 

**Thoughts**: Again I had troubles with Repl.it working right and being able to connect but I got there. I had to make sure that nodemon wasnt running and the double check to cd out of that folder in the terminal and that seemed to get it going. WOW it took an hour.
