# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 75: April 28, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the all the unit and functional tests today. This section was way eaiser than I was expecting from the other projects in this course. Also I got the QA certification today because this was the last test so hurray!

**Thoughts**: All done with QA and now I need to figure out other things to do. I should probably pick a new project and get cracking.
