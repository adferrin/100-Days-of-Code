# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 9: November 5, 2020
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithm section. I will start on the next section tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Just trying to make sure that I'm still working on these courses. I will be making a gatsby project this weekend to bulster up my portfolio.
