# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 8: November 4, 2020
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Basic Algorithm Scripting section which is a nice refresher. I will hopefully finish this today but might not. Still a bit stressed about the election so who knows. 

**Thoughts:** the algorithm section is nice. I'm glad that this course has become a bit more challenging than decalaring variables but I'm still a bit bored. I think that this week I'm going to start to make some static sites like an ecommerce to ramp up my portfolio site.
