# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 6: November 2, 2020
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Data Structures section in the certificate and will begin the Basic Algorithm Scripting section for however long I can keep with it today. 

**Thoughts:** I am enjoying this work but I feel like I might not make as much progress as I should be considering that the election is tomorrow and I am very nervous about it. That being said I will get into some of it today and then more tomorrow. It seems to be ramping up finally and I will actually be challegned as this has been mostly a refresher. That being said, looking at the section titles I did do a bunch of this with GA so it might still just be refreshers.
