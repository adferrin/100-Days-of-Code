# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 45: March 25, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So the portfolio site is almost done which is exciting. I have been inputing all of my projects with their information and making them sound nice.    

**Thoughts**: I really feel less self conscious about this site. The last one I did not feel adequately project the information professionally and took away from just seeing the info. I feel much better.
