# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 39: March 19, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I re did the 25 + 5 clock on codepen.io . I also made a github repo with the code in it if anyone is wondering where it is. That also finishes my front end libraries certification for FCC HURRAY.

**Thoughts**: I'm finially done with this and now can keep pushing through the QA section.
