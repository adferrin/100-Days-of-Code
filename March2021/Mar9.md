# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 33: March 9, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I'm working on the QA course and today was making + linking a database with Mongo. I have done this before but they have updated their UI so I had to do some poking around. Also FCC uses different snytax than I would so adding environmental varaibles wasn't to rough but still took time. 

**Thoughts**: Adding the DB took a little longer than I expected but hey thats the game.
