# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 44: March 24, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Got my second portfolio going today. I'm using gatsby and I picked a starter for a couple of reasons. First, I'm not great at CSS but am ok, second I think that it will convey the my information in a more professional manner and shift the focus from an ok site to the content material. Also now I feel way less self concious about it.    

**Thoughts**: I think that the starters have a time and a place. I like it and inputing my information is super easy. Good on you Gatsby.
