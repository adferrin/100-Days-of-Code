# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 38: March 18, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to take another look at my 25 + 5 clock to try to figure out why I'm having such issues passing these tests. I think that it has might just be as simple as my value of 25 is in string fourm and NAN because of that. I'm going to figure this one out by tomorrow or just start a new one. 

**Thoughts**: I don't know why this has been so difficult for me to figure out but I shouldn't have pushed on to the QA section. I had to take a day just to remember what was going on and how I was doing it. At least I figured it out for next time.
