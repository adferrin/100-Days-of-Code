# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 30: March 6, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I am still working on the QA section of FCC. I finished up the first section and am on to the second. Its not a long course but there are projects that look rather involved but fun. I am looking forward to figuring them out and finishing.    

**Thoughts**: Chai is interesting and learning a new type of tech is always fun.
