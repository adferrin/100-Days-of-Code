# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 27: March 3, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I am still having trouble getting this to pass tests. I know that it is because the first two tests are made so that the value is set to a specific number and my code is written in a string. So its annoying and I'm tyring but its getting old fast. I messed around with CSS today as well trying to go to another part.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm going to have to ask for some help with this one and then hopefully I can get this project over and done with.
