# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 43: March 23, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I am going to take a quick break from FCC to re build my portfolio. I think that I am going to use Gatsby and use a starter. I've talked to a couple of people about this and they say that since I'm not a UX that its not a big deal. 

**Thoughts**: I kinda here for this. I think that it will help present my information in a more professional look and hopefully that will give me that edge that I've been needing.
