# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 36: March 12, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: Getting everything going and ready to start linking up all the math. 

**Thoughts**: I've never been bad with math but this is a bit of a refresher on equations. I'd like to finish by the end of the day but I'm giving myself about 3 - 4 days per project.
