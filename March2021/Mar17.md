# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 37: March 17, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from coding to get a personal project done and am back now. I am still working on the converter am just getting all the math to work.

**Thoughts**: it's a bit of a slow process since I have to look up most of the math but other than that its going well.
