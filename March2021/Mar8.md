# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 32: March 8, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: First section using Chai and Mocha are finished and now onto the Advanced Node section using Pug. I haven't ever used Pug before but it injects html elements into your code by using white space sensitive syntax and generates code. 

**Thoughts**: Uhh I'd rather just write the HTML but whatevs I guess. I dont really understand why this is better or worse but I assume it makes someones life eaiser so I will give it a try.
