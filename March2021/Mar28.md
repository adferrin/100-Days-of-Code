# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 48: March 28, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from my protfolio work to start learning more about AWS services. There is an excellent video up on youtube from FCC, it's like 6 hours long and I only got about an hour through it but good so far.   

**Thoughts**: interesting stuff, FCC always does a good job.
