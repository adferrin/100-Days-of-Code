# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 28: March 4, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I have decided to take a day or two off from my project and start on the QA section of the FCC. I think that it will help me re focus and also I am going to reach out to some friends to see if they can help me figure out my problem. 

**Thoughts**: The QA section is something new to me and is using CHIA which I have never used before. So far it is just learning the basics of that language so that figure out sintax and how the language functions.
