# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 26: March 2, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: well its still working but I am having trouble with the details right now. two of the tests arent passing because of the way my math works and they way that they want it to work which is making me go crazy. Also because they arent passing the earlier tests, the later tests involving those elements are also failing.

**Thoughts**: I'm upset about this one and it works I just cant figure out why some these tests arent passing because all of the functionality does work.
