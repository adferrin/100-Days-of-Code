# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 25: March 1, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I got the promodoro clock working but I am not passing any of the tests mainly because I have the ID's wrong. That being said I am having trouble actually getting them to accept them as IDs. Either way I restarted this project so that I could change it up and use React along with materailize.

**Thoughts**: uhh this one is very hard. I am also frustrated about the tests but oh well, I will figure it out tomorrow.
