# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 31: March 7, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I kept working on the QA course today. I am taking my time with it slowly since its a new bit of tech and I'm not really familar with it yet.   

**Thoughts**: it's going well but I forgot that I had an app called Dash and its great. It allows me to have all the docs on pretty much any language locally and I can't say how much I love being able to type in my queries to it and not google.
