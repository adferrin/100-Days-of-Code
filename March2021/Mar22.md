# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 42: March 22, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the metric converter. Not a super hard project but the tests were not easy. I was getting hung up and then figured out that I had a typo which was also a var and misspelled so it failed the tests. 

**Thoughts**: It went well but when it came to getting it to a live url I ended up using Repl.it because it was a quick easy fix. I tried github pages but since you need to run a server I didnt want to deploy to heroku because there are always problems. Got it running and submitted.
