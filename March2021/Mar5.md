# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 29: March 5, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I started the QA section yesterday and have kept going with the lessons. I haven't used chai before so its new to me but is makeing sense. I also added it to Dash so I have all the docs locally and it is so helpful to have this app. Still trying to work out the last bug with my clock but i'm in no rush at this point. 

**Thoughts**: Chai is interesting and the language is pretty straight forward for now.
