# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 34: March 10, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the last section of the QA course before projects and will start the projects tomrrow. 

**Thoughts**: Uhh so repl.it is always a bit buggy but I had so many problems with it today and yesterday honestly. I had troubles gettin my db connected and today it wouldnt even see dependencies that had been installed when they were very much so in the file because I could see them. I just ended up turning everything off and restarting from fresh to let it mellow out and it worked. I'm glad that I can go back to VS code and not have to use replit because I hate using it but I did not want the headache of cloning / doing heroku.
