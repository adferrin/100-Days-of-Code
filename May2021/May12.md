# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 81: May 12, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I think that I'm going to switch up my projects a bit today. I was going all in on the issue tracker but it has really snowballed out of control. I am still considering a scale back but I may also go and make a to do app.

**Thoughts**: Probably going to just use JavaScript but maybe full stack it up and use React to just round out that I can. Also probably would have like Google Oath or something for no apparent reason other than I can.
