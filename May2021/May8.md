# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 77: May 8, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I took a week off of everything for a vacation and now I'm back at it. 

**Thoughts**: I was looking around at another FCC thing and I think that I am either going to start building an Issue tracker or a to do list. Either way I have begun to start my wire frames and beging the process of figuring out features and user stories.
