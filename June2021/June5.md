# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 93: June 5, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: So I finished the course and am onto the projects.    

**Thoughts**: I liked learning about penetration tests but it was more of a 10,000 ft view than I would have liked. They def explained how things worked but not necessarily how to use it or what to do with it. So overall very interesting but I think it was a bit lack luster.
