# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: October 30, 2020
##### FreeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Debugging part of the course and began on the Data Structures portion. I didn't do the debugging last night becasuse I did a code along with my old instructor Daniel from GA. We built a React app with firebase and used a third party api for some bonus points. Also he showed us CSS custom variables and styled components which are awesome. 

**Thoughts:** the information on FreeCodeCamp is great and its really helping to soldify a lot of the concepts that I learned at GA.
