# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 21: February 22, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I am working on the js calculator still and having some issues. I am not passing two tests but one of them I should be. I can't get the decmial test to pass but you can not enter more than one decimal in the display so I don't know whats up. Also test 13 isnt working which is if more than two operators are entered in the last one input should work. 

**Thoughts**: I'm just a bit done for the day. I can't figure out why the decimal one isn't working for the tests and will have to dig around to figure out why. Thank you Justin Kim for your code along.
