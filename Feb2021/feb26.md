# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 22: February 26, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the JavaScript caluclator and it took me two days ish to figure out why I couldn't pass the double decimal point in one number test. It was a typo..... hurray for me for missing that and taking forever to find it.

**Thoughts**: This one was also pretty fun and really logic heavy which is nice because I still struggle with that. Thanks to Justin Kim for the help and I hope you like it.
