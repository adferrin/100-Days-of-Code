# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 23: February 27, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I started building out the 25 + 5 clock for the final project. Just getting the layout and most of the elements in so that I can start adding all the functionality that I will need.

**Thoughts**: I'm pretty so so about this project but it still should be cool when its done and be full of different functionality. Probably going to use a lot of jQuery get it going and I'm usuing bootstrap as the front end right now.
