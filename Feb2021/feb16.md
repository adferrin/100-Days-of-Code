# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 12: February 16, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I got through 70% of the React section.  

**Thoughts**: I really like React so this a good refreser. It's nice to make these concepts more concreate and see a different way of teaching them from GA. I want to finish this section tomorrow and hopefully the Redux as well.
