# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 16: February 20, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I started getting the build out for the markdown project. I got halfway through the tests and was able to get some of the functionality going. 

**Thoughts**: This was not what I thought it would be but its turning out to be really cool. I didn't think that I would really care about many of these projects but this one is pretty rad. I have been getting help from Useful programmer again because I really like the way that he walks through his process. Hopefully I will finish this one up tomorrow excpet for final styling.
