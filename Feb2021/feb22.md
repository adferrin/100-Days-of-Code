# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 18: February 22, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I have started the next project which is the drum machine from FCC. Just getting the first couple of passing tests and the general set up right now.

**Thoughts**: Hopefully get the grunt work out today and then be able to go through and do most of the styling tomorrow. I'd like to finish it tomorrow but we'll see how hung up I get on styling.
