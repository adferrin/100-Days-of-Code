# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 14: February 18, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I got through the Redux section. I'm still working on the RQG and want to finish it this weekend. 

**Thoughts**: I do not like Redux and would rather use another framework. It was a lot of googling and some helpful videos to do some basic stuff but I got there in the end.
