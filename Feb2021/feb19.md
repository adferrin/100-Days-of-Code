# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 15: February 19, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the React and Redux section so that the last of the course that is not projects. I also minorly styled the random quote machine so that it looks better and added bootstrap to meet the requirements.  

**Thoughts**: That project was fine and pretty simple. I want to start the next project tomorrow and hopefully be done by Sunday. I'm planning on two days per project right now but that could change depending on how difficult they become.
