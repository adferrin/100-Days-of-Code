# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 17: February 21, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the markdown previewer.

**Thoughts**: This was probably the first project from FCC that was actually fun to make. I really enjoyed this project even though its pretty simple, it was still fun. I really like the mirroring going on and the onload functions were cool too. I will start the next project tomorrow and thanks to Useful Programmer for the video help.
