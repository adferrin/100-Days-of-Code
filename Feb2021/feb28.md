# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 24: February 28, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I kept working on the project today getting through some more of the build out stage. Hopefully done tomorrow but maybe one more day.

**Thoughts**: This is going smoothly so far but tomorrow is going to be linking everything up and getting the functionality going. That's usually where I struggle so this might take me two more days.
