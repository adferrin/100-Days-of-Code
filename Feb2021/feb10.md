# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 6: February 10, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the roman numeral converter today. I did need some help figuring it out and watched a video on it from Useful programmer on youtube. It was a little tedious but basically a giant else if statement. 

**Thoughts:** I got it done but then when looking through the hints section all the other solutions were much less code and used some better practices by adding in reusable code. Useful programmer did as well but the solutions on FCC seemed a bit more concise.
