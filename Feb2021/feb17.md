# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 13: February 17, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the React section of the front end frameworks today and just began the Redux. I also kept working on my random quote machine. 

**Thoughts** I haven't ever worked with Redux so I think that this section is going to be more challenging than the React. I think that I'm going to be looking through the docs quite a lot for this section.
