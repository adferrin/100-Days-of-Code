# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 11: February 15, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the SASS section and got about a third of the way through the React section. 

**Thoughts**: The SASS was a bit of a refresher for me and I am not terribly strong in it. I think that I'm going to go and watch a couple of videos on it because it seems very powerful / useful. I really like being able to write CSS functions. The React section is starting from the basics so its a lot of class extends stuff which is a bit tideous but good for getting the core concept down. I just can't wait to get into arrow functions because it makes React a lot more fun
