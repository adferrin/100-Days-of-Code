# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 7: February 11, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the ceaser cipher today. I got a bit hung up on the inital build but was able to figure it out with some help of google. 

**Thoughts**: It was a bit tricky to figure out how to get the indexs to line up and print out what I was looking for but with some trial and error it got done.
