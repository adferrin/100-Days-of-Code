# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 10: February 14, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Bootstrap section and got half way through the jQuery section. 

**Thoughts**: This is going pretty fast. I was pretty strong in bootstrap and CSS in my GA course because I had to figure it out fast in order to make my projects look like an adult made them.
