# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 19: February 23, 2021
##### FreeCodeCamp 

**Today's Progress**: I got my drum machine passing all tests and will continue to work on the styling. 

**Thoughts**: I really liked this project as well. I haven't ever used audio clips or linked them to keystrokes so this was all new and fun. Now I just need to finish up the styling which I am still working on. Tomorrow if I finish I will begin the next project.
